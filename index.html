		<h1>John</h1>

		<h2>Portfolio</h2>

		<p>My name is John.  I graduated with an accounting degree from Cal State Fullerton.  After working in the business and dreading coming to work all day, I decide that I want to follow my dream.  My dream is to one day be a full stack developer.</p>

		</p>I am currently working as a Junior QA analyst as of right now.  This is not my true passion but it gives me a foot in a door.  I hope with hardwork and constantly learning that I could reach my goals one day.</p>

		<p>On my free time I like try new food, go on adventure, and hangout with my friends. </p>

		<h5>I recently went to EDC</h5>
